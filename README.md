In this project, we will walk through the step-by-step process of building a real estate price prediction website. We will begin by building a model using sklearn and linear regression, using the banglore home prices dataset from Kaggle.com. Next, we will write a Python Flask server that will use the saved model to serve HTTP requests. Finally, we will build a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which will allow users to enter home square footage, number of bedrooms, and other features, and call the Python Flask server to retrieve the predicted price.

To build the prediction model, we will cover several data science concepts, including data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, and k-fold cross-validation. We will be using various technologies and tools for this project, such as Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Python Flask, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

The key steps involved in the project are as follows:

Data collection and cleaning: We will need to obtain the necessary data for building the prediction model. We will be using the banglore home prices dataset from Kaggle.com. Once we have the data, we will need to clean it to remove any missing or incorrect values and ensure that it is in a format that can be used by our model.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Before building the model, it's important to understand the data we're working with. We can use tools like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to visualize the data and explore any relationships between the different features.

Feature engineering: We will need to select the relevant features that will be used to predict home prices. This can involve transforming existing features or creating new ones based on domain knowledge or statistical analysis.

Model selection and training: We will use Scikit-learn to build and train the prediction model, using linear regression. We will use techniques such as GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and k-fold cross-validation to ensure that our model is accurate and robust.
